<h1>
    The First Place You Should Visit in Myanmar is Bagan.
</h1>
<p><q>The ancient city of Bagan is perhaps one of the most interesting places in Myanmar. <br>
    Over 2,000 Buddhist monuments dot the Bagan Archeological Zone thatâ€™s spread across 26 square miles.<br>
    The best way to take in the entirety of this breathtaking city is to hop into a hot air balloon and fly over it. <br>
    The rides take place in the wee hours of the morning. <br>
    Carry a good camera so you can take photos of the monuments from above.</q></p>
